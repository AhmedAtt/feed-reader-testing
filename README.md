# Description
This project was part of Udactiy's Front-End developer Nanodegree,I implemented a test suite for a feed reader using Jasmin Framework.

# Specs Tested
This suite ensures that the following is true:
- 'allFeeds' variable has been defined and that it is not empty
- Each element in the feed has A URL defined and it's not empty
- Each element in the feed has A name defined and it's not empty
- The menu is hidden by default
- The menu toggles visibility on click
- There is at least a single entry in the feed when the loadfeed() function is called
- The content of the feed changes when the loadfeed() function is called

# To view test results
- Simply clone or download the project folder and open index.html in any modern browser
